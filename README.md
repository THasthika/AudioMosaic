# AudioMosaic

<!-- AudioMosaic Logo -->

AudioMosaic is an Audio Dataset Manager designed specifically for Machine Learning projects. It provides a simple and intuitive interface to organize, manage, and preprocess audio datasets, making it easier to work with audio data in your machine learning pipeline.

## Features (WIP)
- **Dataset Organization**: AudioMosaic allows you to organize your audio datasets into projects, making it easier to manage multiple datasets for different machine learning tasks.
- **Data Import**: Import audio files from various sources, such as local directories, remote URLs, or cloud storage.
- **Metadata Management**: Annotate and manage metadata associated with your audio files, including labels, tags, and any other relevant information.
- **Preprocessing**: Apply various preprocessing techniques to your audio data, such as audio augmentation, feature extraction, and signal processing.
- **Audio Augmentation**: Perform data augmentation on your audio files to increase the diversity and robustness of your dataset. Apply techniques like time stretching, pitch shifting, background noise addition, and more.
- **Visualization**: Visualize audio waveforms, spectrograms, and other audio representations to gain insights into your dataset.
- **Data Splitting**: Split your dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets, ensuring proper evaluation of your machine learning models.
- **Export**: Export your processed dataset in a format suitable for your machine learning framework or library.
